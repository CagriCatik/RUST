Rust is a modern, statically-typed systems programming language that emphasizes safety, concurrency, and performance. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to the fundamentals of Rust, covering everything from primitive data types to advanced concepts like ownership, borrowing, and control flow.

## Getting Started

To get started with Rust, you'll need to [install the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your system. Once installed, you can compile and run Rust programs using the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build tool.

## Learning Resources

This guide is based on the excellent [Bek Brace YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrOQsSoS-V69UWKxV4FNRJFlHS0DUFQA2), which provides comprehensive video tutorials on Rust fundamentals. Additionally, you can refer to the official [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) for in-depth documentation and examples.
