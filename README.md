# Introduction to Rust Programming Language

ðŸ¦€ Rust is a modern, statically typed language known for its safety, concurrency, and performance. In this guide, we'll cover the fundamentals of Rust, starting from primitive data types to advanced concepts like ownership, borrowing, and control flow.

## Contents:

1. **[Primitive Data Types](./01_Primitive_Data_Types/README.md)**: Explore the basic building blocks of Rust's data types.
2. **[Compound Data Types](./02_Compound_Data_Types/README.md)**: Learn about more complex data structures in Rust.
3. **[Functions](./03_Functions/README.md)**: Understand how functions work and how to define them in Rust.
4. **[Ownership](./04_Ownership/README.md)**: Dive into Rust's unique ownership system and memory management.
5. **[Borrowing & References](./05_Borrowing_and_References/README.md)**: Discover how Rust handles borrowing and references to ensure memory safety.
6. **[Variables & Mutability](./06_Variables_&_Mutability/README.md)**: Explore variable declaration and mutability in Rust.
7. **[Constants](./07_Constants/README.md)**: Learn about constants and their usage in Rust.
8. **[Shadowing](./08_Shadowing/README.md)**: Understand the concept of shadowing in Rust.
9. **[Comments](./09_Comments/README.md)**: Explore different ways to add comments to your Rust code.
10. **[If Else Statements / Control Flow](./10_If_Else_Statements_Control_Flow/README.md)**: Delve into Rust's control flow mechanisms, including if-else statements.
